### 4.4 server compatibility issues

1. 🦖 `MapReduce` operation was rewritten in server version 4.4 and the driver version has several properties inaccessible as a result of using an old operation: `Duration`, `EmitCount`, `OutputCount`, `InputCount`. Additionally result order is no longer guaranteed. Non-legacy part of the driver has an up-to-date API which functions correctly.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-2738: Deprecate mapparams, out.sharded, and out.nonAtomic arguments to mapReduce](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-2738)
2. `AggregateExplain` operation structure changed. No big deal, since it is intended to be read by humans.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-2842: The format of Aggregate Explain response has been changed](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-2842)
3. 🦖 `GridFS.Download` not working on sharded cluster configuration.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-3423: Fix CSharp269Tests.TestUploadAndDownload GridFs test on sharded cluster](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3423)

### latest server compatibility issues

4. 🦖 `GeoSearch` and `GeoHaystack` operations were removed from 4.9.0 server. These operations are from legacy part of the driver and server returns quite comprehensible exception.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-3249: Skip geoSearch and geoHaystack tests when running against server version that doesn't support these commands](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3249)
5. `CreateIndexesOperation` result field `expireAfterSeconds` value is rounded since 4.9.0.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-3294: Fix CreateIndexesOperationTests tests on latests](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3294)
6. 🦖 `CreateIndex` with `WildcardProjection` reports result `_id` value as boolean (`{ _id : true }`) instead of int (`{ _id : 1 }`) starting from 4.5.0. That's fine, since it is legacy API.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-3078: Fix test CreateIndex_with_wildcardProjection_should_create_expected_index on latest](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3078)
7. 🦖 `ReIndex` command fails on replica set configuration, but works on standalone as it used to. This operation is part of legacy API.
See respective change in 2.11.0 driver: [CSHARP-3058: Make 'reIndex' a standalone-only command](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3058)
8. `trunkatedArrays` field is not handled in `ChangeStreamDocument.UpdateDescription` property deserialization, causing the access to the property throw and exception `System.FormatException : Invalid field name: "truncatedArrays".` since server version 4.9.0. Other properties work as intended.
See respective ticket: [CSHARP-3212: Add new field truncatedArrays into cursor.nextBatch.updateDescription](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-3212)
